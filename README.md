### What I learned

Ever started a project with so much dread it courses through your whole body? Yeah… that was me when I began this one.

Honestly, if there’s anything I dread in the world of web development, it’s forms, especially forms with validation. But make it a multi-step form? Oh, Father, let this cup pass from me! 

But did it pass? No, it did not.

Like my Lord and Saviour, I submitted to the will of learning, and here I am, on the other side. I remember muttering a whole prayer at the start:
"Father, help me, for I tread on a rowdy path I have never walked. See me through to the end of this perilous time."

And listen, I’ll tell you this for free: it takes grit for me to work on anything involving forms. Whenever I can’t avoid it, I know I need to stock up on enough courage and mental energy to carry me through to the end.

But guess what?

We made it. We’re here. We did the thing.
